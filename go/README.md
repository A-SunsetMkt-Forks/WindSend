# WindSend Go Version

## Overview

This directory contains the Go implementation of WindSend. While the Go version has been instrumental in providing these functionalities, it has reached its end of life as of version v1.3.0. 

The project has since transitioned to a Rust implementation, which offers improved performance, better memory safety, and a more active development roadmap. We highly recommend users to migrate to the Rust version of WindSend for continued support and updates.
